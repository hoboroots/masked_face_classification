# Masked Face Classification

## About Masked Face Classification
This web-based application is developed to classify two classes of people's faces: wearing mask and not wearing mask.

### Project Goal
To accurately identify whether a person is wearing mask or not.
Further goal: To help monitor compliance of people wearing mask in public places.

### Possible Implementation

Since monitoring compliance is expensive and time consuming, this mask classification project can be deployed further for a real-time masked/unmasked face recognition in CCTV surveillance system to help government enforce the regulation of wearing mask in public places. Hence, the system can help contribute to suppress the spread of the virus in Indonesia.
